# Flycat Web Client

Another [Nostr](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips) web client.

~~Integrating with [flycat protocol](https://github.com/digi-monkey/flycat-protocol) to bring a blogging and reading experience on Nostr.~~ ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ We have migrated to [Nip-23](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/23.md) for interoperability!

## Main Differences

- short notes and long blog posts all-in-one web client
- use SharedWorker to manage websocket connections across different tabs

## Join

Flycat is a open source project and would love to have a community building and maintaining for it. We are looking for volunteers:

- UI/UX designer
- very good frontend engineer(bc I am a bad one)
