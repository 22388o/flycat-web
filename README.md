# Flycat Web Client

Another [Nostr](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips) web client.

Integrating with [flycat protocol](https://github.com/digi-monkey/flycat-protocol) to bring a blogging and reading experience on Nostr.

## Main Differences

- new feature: create blog right on Nostr
- use SharedWorker to manage websocket connections, which should consume less traffic for relays
- typescript + React, easy to maintain and extend from
- 2000s style UI weather you like it or not

## Join

Flycat is a open source project and would love to have a community building and maintaining for it. We are looking for volunteers:

- UI/UX designer
- very good frontend engineer(bc I am a bad one)
